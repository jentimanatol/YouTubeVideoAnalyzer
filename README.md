## 💡 Why I Built This

YouTube is a huge educational and cultural archive — but pulling structured information from it can be tedious. I built this app to make metadata collection simple, fast, and user-friendly for anyone doing research, teaching, or organizing content.

It reflects my interest in:

* Digital automation  
* Data analysis & media studies  
* Ethical access to open content  
* UI simplicity with real utility  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* `Python 3.11+`  
* `pytube` (for video data and download)  
* `tkinter` (for GUI)  
* `os`, `threading`, `datetime` (core modules)  
* `matplotlib` (optional visual analytics)

Optional:  
* `pyinstaller` — for `.exe` packaging  
* `pydub` — for enhanced audio conversion
