## 💡 Why I Built This

YouTube is a vast archive of educational, cultural, and social content — but extracting structured data from it can be time-consuming.

This app was built to simplify metadata and transcript collection for:

- Academic research  
- Content organization  
- Digital media analysis  

It reflects my passion for:

- Automation and digital efficiency  
- Media and data literacy  
- Accessible open-source tools  
- Clean, practical UI design
